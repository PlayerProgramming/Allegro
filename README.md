[Allegro](https://www.playallegro.com/) is a web application designed to make learning sheet music more fun through interactive games!

As opposed to the traditional method of learning to read music in a boring music book with your instructor or tutorial videos,  
Allegro teaches you sheet music through playing games. 

With a fun scoring system and constructive feedback, we are sure you wil learn music fast and most importantly, have fun while you do it.
